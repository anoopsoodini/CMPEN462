The Penn State Alma Mater
Lyrics
For the Glory of Old State
For her founders strong and great.
For the future that we wait,
Raise the song, raise the song.
Sing our love and loyalty,
Sing our hopes that bright and free
Rest, O Mother, dear with thee
All with thee, all with thee.
When we stood at childhoods gate,
Shapeless in the hands of fate,
Thou didst mold us dear old State
Dear Old State, dear old State.
May no act of ours bring shame
To one heart that loves thy name,
May our lives but swell thy fame,
Dear old State, dear old State.
